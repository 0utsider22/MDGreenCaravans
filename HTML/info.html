    <h2>Why Buy From Us?</h2>
    <p>Drawing from over 30 years of combined experience in the maintenance, repair and sale of caravans, you can be sure
      that any caravan purchased from MDGreen Caravans has been thoroughly inspected and serviced to the 
      highest of professional standards. <br>
      All MDG caravans come with 9+ months Victorian registration meaning you can hook on, load up and hit the road with
      the sort of confidence you can't get with a private sale.

    <h2>Testimonials</h2>
    <p>Purchasing a caravan from Matt has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. His communication and transparency about what
       work had been done to the van reassured me this was the van for me! 
      He was extremely knowledgeable and very easy to speak to when trying to organise a time and day to come and have a look around. <br>
      When inspecting the van Matt gave me a complete rundown on the caravan's build, service history and features. Matt was more than
      happy to answer any questions I had before purchasing this van and even let my dog come in and have a look around! He also helped
      me through the process of organising insurance for my new van! <br> 
      I can't recommend visiting Matt if you are looking to invest in a caravan! You won't be disappointed! 
      <br>Thanks Matt! <br> <br>
